Download the code & run **npm install** to install dependencies before starting the app.

You'll also need to install Material UI as a dependency. To do this run **npm install @material-ui/core**

### Next steps

1. add google fonts to index.html
2. Install icons (npm install @material-ui/icons)
3. Need to run json server / setup db.json file in /data.
